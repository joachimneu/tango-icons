The GNOME Tango icons (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Desktop_icons) seem to all (?) be under CC BY-SA 3.0 US (the "Unofficial / Extras" ones at the end of the page seem to be under GPL), and were thus not included in this package.

Other "non-official" icons from http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Library were also not included.

Unofficial Tango icons from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Tango_icons were downloaded and included, if their license was Public Domain or CC0.
